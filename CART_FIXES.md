# Cart Issues Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. ✅ Cart dropdown not updating after adding items
**Problem**: When clicking cart icon on homepage to add items, the navbar cart count/dropdown wasn't updating until page refresh.

**Solution**:
- Fixed `handleAddSuccess` method in `cart_controller.js` to call `updateMiniCart()`
- Added proper cart count updating with `updateCartCount()` method
- Ensured mini cart refreshes after each cart operation

### 2. ✅ Remove buttons not working in navbar dropdown
**Problem**: Trash/remove buttons in mini cart dropdown didn't delete items.

**Solution**:
- Added `data-controller="cart"` to mini cart container
- Added proper `data-action="click->cart#removeItem"` and `data-cart-item-id` attributes to remove buttons
- Fixed `removeItem` method to handle both `data-cart-item-id` and `data-item-id` attributes
- Added confirmation dialog for deletions

### 3. ✅ Remove button not working in cart page
**Problem**: "Remove" button in `/cart` page didn't delete items.

**Solution**:
- Fixed data attribute naming inconsistency
- Ensured proper cart controller connection with `data-controller="cart"`
- Updated `performCartAction` method to properly handle DELETE operations and remove DOM elements

### 4. ✅ Quantity updates not working in cart page
**Problem**: +/- buttons and manual quantity input changes weren't updating cart totals or saving.

**Solution**:
- Fixed method naming conflict: renamed `updateQuantity(event)` to `updateQuantityFromInput(event)`
- Updated cart view to use correct action: `data-action="change->cart#updateQuantityFromInput"`
- Ensured `increaseQuantity` and `decreaseQuantity` methods call the correct `updateQuantity(cartItemId, quantity)` helper
- Added proper cart summary updates after quantity changes

### 5. ✅ Coupon codes not working
**Problem**: Coupon system was hardcoded and didn't provide proper feedback.

**Solution**:
- Created `Coupon` model with full validation and business logic
- Added database migrations for coupons table and cart associations
- Implemented proper coupon validation (expiry, usage limits, minimum order amounts)
- Updated `Cart` model with robust `apply_coupon` and `remove_coupon` methods
- Enhanced `CartsController` to handle coupon applications with proper JSON responses
- Updated cart JavaScript to show success/error messages for coupon operations
- Created sample coupons: SAVE10, SAVE20, FREESHIP, WELCOME5

## Features Added:

### Coupon System:
- **SAVE10**: 10% off (max $25 discount) on orders $50+
- **SAVE20**: 20% off (max $50 discount) on orders $100+
